# WDI 34 Project 3
## A MEAN Stack App
###### by Arabella Dear, Bianca Jemsten and James Newell

The goal of project 3 was to build a full MEAN stack app in a team. We chose to build an app that allows the user to search for an event they're going to by using [Skiddle's Event API](https://github.com/Skiddle/web-api/wiki/Events-API), and by fetching the coordinates of the event we generated a list of restaurants and bars using [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro). The user can then add other users to the event and calculate the travel time from their current position using the [City Mapper API](https://citymapper.com/api).

Technologies used in the project were Angular, JavaScript, SCSS, HTML, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js and Webpack.

Our app is deployed on [Heroku](https://fast-plains-52637.herokuapp.com/#!/).

We used [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to plan out the interface of our app. It helped us to envision how the user flow would be as well as to make sure all memebers of our team were on the same level as to how certain features would look and work.

###### Task planning

Before the project started we planned out every task that had to be done and put them into [Trello Cards](https://trello.com/biancajemsten/boards). We used the color labels to indicate if it was a fontend or backend task(blue vs. red) and if it was a task crucial for MVP or an add-on (green vs. yellow). Initially everything was in the backlog. Then as we started building the app we moved cards to the other categories which were Doing (frontend), Doing (backend), To do, Bugs, and Done.
