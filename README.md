# WDI 34 Project 3
## A MEAN Stack App
###### by Arabella Dear, Bianca Jemsten and James Newell

The goal of project 3 was to build a full MEAN stack app in a team. We chose to build an app that allows the user to search for an event they're going to by using [Skiddle's Event API](https://github.com/Skiddle/web-api/wiki/Events-API), and by fetching the coordinates of the event we generated a list of restaurants and bars using [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro). The user can then add other users to the event and calculate the travel time from their current position using the [City Mapper API](https://citymapper.com/api).

Technologies used in the project were Angular, JavaScript, SCSS, HTML, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js and Webpack.

Our app is deployed on [Heroku](https://fast-plains-52637.herokuapp.com/#!/).
